# Small Files UFOs (series 2)

Digital photographs made on Commodore Amiga 500 with a video capture device called Digi View (v4) from 1989. The device consists of shooting images with a compatible camcorder (Hi8 for example) and then connecting it to the Amiga via the Digi View interface (plugged into the parallel port).
To obtain colour images, the subject must be filmed 3 times through red, green and blue gelatins (supplied with the Digi View), the RGB image then being recomposed via the software.
In order to obtain screenshots readable on current computers, the images produced on Amiga 500 and cathode ray tube were saved on Amiga floppy disk, transformed into a PC .adf file and finally read on the WinUAE emulator. The PNG format corresponds to the screen capture on PC, the original Amiga format is HAM in 4096 colours.

For this mini-series of 5 images, I have chosen to evoke the photographs of UFOs whose low definition generates a lot of suppositions and interpretations. [David-Olivier Lartigaud, Random(lab)-ESADSE]
