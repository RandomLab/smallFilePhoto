Photographs taken with a Casio watch called [Wrist Camera](https://maxmax.com/aXRayCasioWristCamera.htm) from 1999.
The images it can produce are 120x120 pixels in size and weigh about 6 kb. They can be retrieved from a computer via an infrared interface.
For this mini-series of 5 images, we have chosen to evoke the photographs of UFOs whose low definition generates a lot of suppositions and interpretations. The photographs were taken in daylight because the camera is not very efficient in low light.
